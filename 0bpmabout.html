Zero beats per minute is the name of a fiction based on “The State of Thigs” by Wim Wenders. In this fictional world, time goes by in a different way. A slower way.
<br>
<br>
It has been many years since the last person died. No one remembers death, at least death within humans. Time is perceived through other things, exterior to us. Objects. They have a life, they appear and disappear, they are usefull and then useless. They make us perceive time through their degradation or loss of function. Everything is connected – people and innanimate objects - and loss is now a different subject, since time influences how we perceive it.
