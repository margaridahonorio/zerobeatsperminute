	A Week in a Life is a small documentary series that follows Ana Lua through five days of her eternal life. This is not just another week, it represents a turning point. Ana Lua got attached to her bench, she spends a lot of time with it. But it is on the verge of breaking. When it finally does, she needs to say goodbye properly. Spirituality helps her cope with a different kind of death, the death of an object. This was an ending, but there is never a final end for Ana Lua.
